          h2 What are they?
          ul
            li.fragment Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are algorithms that use Darwinian principles to reactively converge upon optimal solutions in their environment.
            br
            li.fragment Technical Definition: "A machine learning technique used to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program's ability to perform a given computational task."
            br
            li.fragment Sound complicated? GAs are easy to think about when we use metaphors from occurences in nature.

        section
          h2 Darwinian Theory
          p.fragment "All species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce." - Wikipedia
          p.fragment If we want to abstract this theory into code let's first drill down the concept.
          br
          ul
            li.fragment In nature, the process of evolution has no contextual knowledge. It's 'dumb'.
            br
            li.fragment Various expressions of traits are selected to be passed on based on their results of a fitness ranking among the survivors.

        section
          p DNA and Genes
          ul
            li 'Genes' are the metaphor for features or traits in a problem space.
            li Collectively Genes are referred to as 'DNA'
            li GAs recombinate Genes in DNA to hopefully evolve better and better solutions.
            li Applying GA means carefully selecting the problem features to use in your DNA.



        section
          h2 What's in a GA? Actors
          p Actors what we call individuals within a population.
          ul
            li Actors have their own DNA contributed by their parents or random chance.
            li Actors are evaluated for fitness.
            li Actors breed, some more than others.
            li Actors die..

        section
          h2 What's in a GA? Populations
          ul
            li A Population is a discrete generation of actors.
            li Populations have sizes. Some GA's might use fixed or variable population sizes.
            li The Population or generation size is a critical input to any GA.

        section
          h2 Caveats
            br
            li.fragment Diversity is key! If there isn't enough variance among the initial population the population will have a hard time improving upon their previous generation.
            br
            li.fragment Random mutations are introduced during reproduction.
            br
            li.fragment GAs optimize for 'fitness'.
            ul
              li.fragment The better specimens have an easier time to pass on their genes and so the better actors will propagate.
            br
            li.fragment without actual analysis of the rules of the problem given enough variance GAs will converge upon an approximate solution.
